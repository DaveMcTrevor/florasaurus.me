			<h2>Fertilizer</h2>
			<p>Types of nutrients:</p>
			<ul>
				<li><span>Macronutrients:</span> These are required by plants in relatively large quantities. They include nitrogen (N), phosphorus (P), and potassium (K), often referred to as NPK. These nutrients play crucial roles in various aspects of plant growth, such as leaf development, root growth, and flower and fruit production.</li>
				<li><span>Micronutrients:</span> Plants need these in smaller amounts. Examples include iron, zinc, manganese, and copper. Although needed in lower quantities, micronutrients are still vital for overall plant health.</li>
			</ul>
			<p>Fertilizer Formulations:</p>
			<ul>
					<li>Fertilizers come in various formulations, often represented by a set of three numbers on the packaging indicating the percentage of nitrogen, phosphorus, and potassium in that order. For example, a 10-20-10 fertilizer contains 10% nitrogen, 20% phosphorus, and 10% potassium.</li>
			</ul>
			<p>Application:</p>
			<ul>
					<li><span>Timing:</span> Fertilizing frequency depends on the type of plant and the fertilizer used. Common schedules include monthly, bi-monthly, or following package instructions.</li>
					<li><span>Method:</span> Fertilizers can be applied in various ways, such as mixing them into the soil, sprinkling them on the surface, or dissolving them in water for application.</li>
			</ul>
			<p>Considerations:</p>
			<ul>
					<li><span>Seasonal Variations:</span>Plants may have different nutrient needs during different stages of growth or seasons.</li>
					<li><span>Plant Type:</span>Different plants have different nutrient requirements. For example, flowering plants may benefit from a fertilizer with a higher phosphorus content to support blooming.</li>
			</ul>
			<p>Organic vs. Synthetic Fertilizers:</p>
			<ul>
				<li><span>Organic:</span>Derived from natural sources, like compost, manure, or bone meal. They release nutrients slowly but contribute to soil health.</li>
				<li><span>Synthetic:</span>Manufactured with specific nutrient ratios. They provide a quick nutrient boost but may lack the long-term soil improvement benefits of organic options.</li>
				<li>Always follow the recommended dosage on the fertilizer packaging, as over-fertilizing can harm plants. Understanding the specific needs of your plants and the composition of the fertilizer will help you provide the right nutrients for optimal growth.</li>
